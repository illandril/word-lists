All datasets in this directory originated from the Google Ngram project.
This data was then filtered and re-formatted...
- Only ngrams that contain only the letters A-Z (w/o diacritics) were kept
- Only ngrams of length 4 through 9 were kept
- All letters were converted to upper-case, and ngrams that were the same except for the case were merged
- Only data from the years specified years were kept
- The data was adjusted to the format `NGRAM\tCOUNTS\tCOUNTS\t...`, where `COUNTS` are all converted using `Math.round(Math.log10(value))`
  - Blank = no records for that year for that ngram
  - Single number = Both record count and volume count are the same (after conversion)
  - `#,#` = `match_count,volume_count`
- The data was compressed using Brotli compression
- The ngrams were split based on ngram length
